## LabViewProjects / LabView

A collection of **LabVIEW Virtual Instruments (VIs)** and example projects, maintained by the LabViewProjects community.

### üì¶ What‚Äôs Inside

This repository contains various LabVIEW example programs, demonstrations and reference VIs including:

* LED and color control examples (e.g. *4ColorLED.vi*)
* GUI & control interactions (buttons, switches, forms)
* Event-handling and callback demonstrations
* Data acquisition & serial communication (e.g. serial read)
* Signal generation, charts, random numbers
* Utility subVIs, case vs event logic, loops, numeric operations

These examples are intended for educational use, prototyping, testing, and as starting points for more complex LabVIEW applications.

### ‚öô Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open one of the `.vi` files using LabVIEW (version compatible with the file).
3. Run, experiment with inputs, modify logic, or integrate into your own projects.
4. Use the VIs as templates or building blocks for more advanced applications.

### üöÄ Why Use This Repo

* **Hands-on learning**: Explore how typical LabVIEW tasks are implemented (e.g. event handling, I/O).
* **Jumpstart development**: Use example VIs as scaffolding for building your own systems.
* **Community collaboration**: Contribute new examples, improve existing code, cover more LabVIEW features.

### üß© Contributing

Contributions are welcome! You can help by:

* Adding new VI examples (measurements, control, signal processing, UI)
* Improving documentation or comments within VIs
* Organizing folder structure, naming conventions
* Submitting pull requests with tests or demonstrations

### üìù License & Notes

* Please include a license file (e.g. MIT, BSD) to clarify usage rights.
* Document which LabVIEW versions the VIs are compatible with.
* Feel free to add a ‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù VI or index README to guide newcomers.
